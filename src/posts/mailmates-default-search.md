I found a brilliant little gem in the [MailMate](http://freron.com) menus: you
can change what MailMate searches by default! For a while now I've been
frustrated by the default search because it only searched the "from" field of my
emails and I generally just want to search everything. So, I set up my search
with to look through the "Common Headers or Body":

<img src="/images/search-dropdown.png" alt="Screenshot showing the searchable
fields" title="Common Headers or Body is the way to go" transform-images="avif
webp jpg 300@2">

And then hit the button:

<img src="/images/search-default.png" alt="Screenshot showing menu item to make
a search the default" title="Set it as the default" transform-images="avif webp
jpg 300@2">

Simple enough, but it alleviated some pain for me.
